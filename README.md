Biblio-Dash is an AI-driven tool that identifies books from cover images. 
It uses EasyOCR to extract text, which is then used to query the Google Books API for metadata. 
Built with Python, it leverages OpenCV for image processing and Flask for the web interface, providing efficient book cataloging and information retrieval.
